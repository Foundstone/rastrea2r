Collecting & Hunting for Indicators of Compromise (IOC) with gusto and style! by @aboutsecurity

Ever wanted to turn your AV console into an Incident Response & Threat Hunting machine? Rastrea2r (pronounced "rastreador" - hunter- in Spanish) is a multi-platform open source tool that allows incident responders and SOC analysts to triage suspect systems and hunt for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) across thousands of endpoints in minutes. To parse and collect artifacts of interest from remote systems (including memory dumps), rastrea2r can execute sysinternal, system commands and other 3rd party tools across multiples endpoints, saving the output to a centralized share for automated or manual analysis. By using a client/server RESTful API, rastrea2r can also hunt for IOCs on disk and memory across multiple systems using YARA rules. As a command line tool, rastrea2r can be easily integrated within McAfee ePO, as well as other AV consoles and orchestration tools, allowing incident responders and SOC analysts to collect forensics evidence and hunt for IOCs without the need for an additional agent, with 'gusto' and style!

# Dependencies

** General

Python 2.7.x

https://www.python.org/

** Server.py

Bottle: pip install bottle

** Client 

Yara: latest yara-python from Google code (https://plusvic.github.io/yara/)

DO NOT install yara-ctypes using pip install yara!!

PSutil for win64: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil

WMI for win32: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/WMI/

Requests: pip install requests

# Compiling rastrea2r

Make sure you have all the dependencies installed for the binary you are going to build on your Windows box. Then install:

Pywin32: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/ ** Windows only

Pyinstaller: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki

# Current functionality in v0.7.1

yara-disk: Yara scan for file/directory objects on disk

yara-mem: Yara scan for running processes in memory

memdump: Acquires a memory dump from the endpoint ** Windows only

triage: Collects triage information from the endpoint ** Windows only

web-hist: Collects and parses browsing history for all users in the system (ie, firefox, chrome and opera). ** Windows only NEW!

prefetch: Collects and parses prefetch folder from the endpoint ** Windows only NEW! 


** Notes

For memdump and triage modules, SMB shares must be set up in this specific way:

-- Binaries (sysinternals, batch files and others) must be located in a shared folder called TOOLS (read only)

\\\\path-to-share-folder\tools

-- Output is sent to a shared folder called DATA (write only)

\\\\path-to-share-folder\data

For yara-mem and yara-disk scans, the yara rules must be in the same directory where the server is executed from.

The RESTful API server stores data received in a file called results.txt in the same directory.
